# Penko Reader

**Penko Reader** is an accessibility-focused reading tool designed to help users focus, read faster, and improve comprehension. It is part of the **Penko Software Education Branch**.

This application uses the **RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)** method to display text one word at a time at a user-controlled speed. This method is particularly effective for users with ADHD, dyslexia, or those who find large blocks of text overwhelming.

## Features

*   **Distraction-Free Reading:** RSVP display keeps eyes focused on a single point.
*   **Offline First:** Fully functional without an internet connection. No data is sent to any server.
*   **Privacy Focused:** No tracking, no accounts, no AI data scraping.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   OpenDyslexic font support.
    *   High contrast themes (Light/Dark).
    *   Adjustable font size and speed (WPM).
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Interface and library support for 10+ languages.
*   **Format Support:** Read `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.epub` files locally.

## Pending Features

*   **Dictionary Lookup:** Offline dictionary support is currently in development and will be enabled in a future update once reliable open-source dictionary data is integrated.
